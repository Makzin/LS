# In other practice problems, we have looked at how the scope of variables affects the modification of one "layer" when they are passed to another.

# To drive home the salient aspects of variable scope and modification of one scope by another, consider the following similar sets of code.

# What will be printed by each of these code groups?

# A)

def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one = two
  two = three
  three = one
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}"
puts "two is: #{two}"
puts "three is: #{three}"

# Shouldn't affect the original value of the variables. One should still be 'one', two should still be 'two' and three should still be 'three'. It just reassigns the local 'one' variable to a different object. 

# B)

def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one = "two"
  two = "three"
  three = "one"
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}"
puts "two is: #{two}"
puts "three is: #{three}"

#same thing as A

# C)

def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one.gsub!("one","two")
  two.gsub!("two","three")
  three.gsub!("three","one")
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}"
puts "two is: #{two}"
puts "three is: #{three}"

#this one IS different, since the gsub! is a mutating method. The local variable is referencing the same object as the outer variable, and when the gsub! method is called on the local variable, the actual object gets modified. Therefore, one will be 'two', two will be 'three' and three will be 'one'
