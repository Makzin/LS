# Write a method that takes two arguments: the first is the starting number, and the second is the ending number. Print out all numbers between the two numbers, except if a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz", if a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz", and finally if a number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

# Example:

def fizzbuzz(num1, num2)
  number_array = (num1..num2).to_a
  number_array.each do |num|
    if (num % 3 == 0 && num % 5 == 0)
      puts 'FizzBuzz'
    elsif num % 5 == 0
      puts 'Buzz'
    elsif num % 3 == 0
      puts 'Fizz'
    else
      puts num
    end
  end
end


fizzbuzz(1, 15) # -> 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz
